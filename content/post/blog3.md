> Kubernetes Engine is a managed, production-ready environment for deploying containerized applications. 

#### Introduction 
Kubernetes is a powerful open-source system, initially developed by Google, for managing containerized applications in a clustered environment. It aims to provide better ways of managing related, distributed components and services across varied infrastructure.

In this guide, we'll discuss some of Kubernetes' basic concepts. We will talk about the architecture of the system, the problems it solves, and the model that it uses to handle containerized deployments and scaling.

#### What is Kubernetes
Kubernetes, at its basic level, is a system for running and coordinating containerized applications across a cluster of machines. It is a platform designed to completely manage the life cycle of containerized applications and services using methods that provide predictability, scalability, and high availability.

As a Kubernetes user, you can define how your applications should run and the ways they should be able to interact with other applications or the outside world. You can scale your services up or down, perform graceful rolling updates, and switch traffic between different versions of your applications to test features or rollback problematic deployments. Kubernetes provides interfaces and composable platform primitives that allow you to define and manage your applications with high degrees of flexibility, power, and reliability.

#### Benefits
* **Deploy a Wide Variety of Applications**: Kubernetes Engine enables rapid application development and iteration by making it easy to deploy, update, and manage your applications and services.

* **Operate Seamlessly with High Availability**:Control your environment from the built-in Kubernetes Engine dashboard in Google Cloud console. Use routine health checks to detect and replace hung, or crashed, applications inside your deployments.

* **Scale Effortlessly to Meet Demand**: Go from a single machine to thousands: Kubernetes Engine autoscaling allows you to handle increased user demand for your services, keeping them available when it matters most. Then, scale back in the quiet periods to save money, or schedule low-priority batch jobs to use up spare cycles. Kubernetes Engine helps you get the most out of your resource pool. 

* **Move Freely between On-premises and Clouds**: Kubernetes Engine runs Certified Kubernetes ensuring portability across clouds and on-premises.
